# Real WebP
This is a new image file format that will revolutionize the world of technology. It encodes images as pixels (crazy, right?), where the color of each pixel is described by an HTML color code (the word not the hex code)  

# Demo
Here is an example 4x3 Real WebP file:
```
RWP 4 3
red orange yellow green
cyan blue magenta red
white grey dimgrey black
```
